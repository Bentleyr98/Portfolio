    <h2>WDD330: Week Seven Notes</h2>
    <hr> 
    <p>
        It's kind of embarrassing, but even though I was completing the reading, I didn't realize that we were supposed
        to use the Quiz Ninja as our exercises to submit. I thought it was the sandbox that I was supposed to use.
        It feels good to finally be on the same page with that.
        With that, there was a section of the reading that I just didn't understand

        """
            function multiplier(x,y) {
            if (y === undefined) {
            return function(z) {
            return x * z;
            }
            } else {
            return x * y;
            }
            }
        """
        Where is the z coming from here? How does the function know which value to input into that return function?
        Why not use a static one and just import the x?
        I would appreciate any clarity you can give me on the purpose behind using z here. Thanks!
