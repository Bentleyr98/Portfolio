        <hr> 
        <p>A lot of this reading did feel more like review for me, but I most definitely learned some things
            I hadn't even thought to research. The shortcut for special characters was really fun to learn and 
            to see how I can make my code more effecient. More or less, I loved learning and seeing how Javascript, HTML,
            and CSS can compliment and work better together. I would really enjoy experiencing more how to do that.

        <ul>
            <li>For calling class methods we can use brackets and the dot notation to call them.</li>
            <li>Special Characters shortcuts below</li>
            <li>. matches any character, except line breaks</li>
            <li>\w matches any word character, and is equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9_]</li>
            <li>\W matches any non-word character, and is equivalent to [\^A-Za-z0-9_]</li>
            <li>\d matches any digit character, and is equivalent to [0-9]</li>
            <li>\D matches any non-digit character, and is equivalent to [^0-9]</li>
            <li>\s matches any whitespace character, and is equivalent to [ \t\r\n\f]</li>
            <li>\S matches any non-whitespace character, and is equivalent to [^ \t\r\n\f]</li>
            <li>The DOM can be very handy for editing our HTML and CSS in real time to see the changes.
                It can also be helpful in seeing how rules apply and catching errors.
            </li>
            <li>We can remove event listeners with a simple piece of code to fix it.</li>
        </ul>
