        <h2>WDD330: Week One Notes</h2>
        <hr> 
        <p>This week's assignment was a great review for me. I've delved a bit into local storage in a previous class, but I 
            enjoyed seeing it used and discussed in different ways. I also liked the course on mobile UX. There was a lot 
            I could relate to as a sometimes frustrated consumer as well, it was good to see the points he brought up to
            keep our designs simple and focus on the content. Here are some of my notes from this week's reading assignment.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Local storage is designed to help make our jobs easier, but also making the user experience easier when they
                return to a website. Granted, you should do all you can to ensure that the user feels safe and secure on your
                website, while also making it useful for them.
            </li>
            <li>Break up functions to keep them simple and focused.</li>
            <li>Design small and clean, then grow to fit larger screen sizes.</li>
            <li>Don't make users think. Do as much as we can on the developer's side to make it an easy and smooth
                user experience for them. Let your software do the thinking for them.
            </li>
            <li>For mobile design, put the most used at the bottom (people tend to use thumbs more on mobile devices), 
                like the menu and search bars, or other well used features.</li>
        </ul>
