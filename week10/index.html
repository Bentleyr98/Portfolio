    <h2>WDD330: Week Ten Notes</h2>
    <hr> 
    <p>
        I have a question about the team assignment. My teammates were
        able to get their location from the api, but mine kept bringing
        up an error because it wasn't secure or something? We had the exact
        same code though. Do you know how I can fix that? Or will it just 
        need to be on a different browser?
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Returning response from a fetch is actually an object. We add on .json()
            to extract the json. I wonder what other methods we could use to manipulate
            the data back in different ways.
        </li>
        <li>
            If we can also use fetch() for posting data, can we use this method
            to test our code/logic and that it will post or pull the correct data?
        </li>
        <li>
            Reading further on this, it's pretty interesting to see how these different 
            methods when calling/posting data can improve automated tests. That way we don't 
            need to go in the UI to manually test it, but write tests that'll check it for us.
        </li>
        <li>
            How does security fit into this? If we are posting/pulling data from our API(s),
            would we just encrypt it as it goes over the web?
        </li>
        <li>
            Form validation is for a better experience for the clients, and better security for them
            and us.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remember to use ":valid" or ":invalid" to apply CSS to validated form elements.
        </li>
        <li>
            We don't want our forms to be in any way frustrating for the user. Make what we 
            want entered in crystal clear. Hold the user's hand each step of the way so they'll 
            walk a walk with a positive feeling and want to use our website again.
        </li>
        <li>
            Form fields have a lot of flexibility with javascript. This will be really useful
            in building more dynamic websites that'll work smarter and cleaner.
        </li>
        <li>
            Have a testing mindset when building forms or any website really.
            We want the user to have the best experience.
        </li>
    </ul>
