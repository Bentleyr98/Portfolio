        <h2>WDD330: Week Two Notes</h2>
        <hr> 
        <p>This week definitely had a bit more reading than I was expecting. I still really enjoyed it. I also got to meet with my teammates this 
            week and work on the assignment together. I'm always so impressed about how others think on their feet when it comes to coding. The 
            assignment went well though and I finished the reading. I was amazed to learn of some of the nuances with various functions and behaviors
            that JS has, it really is a powerful language. If I get time, I would love to create more detailed notes by demonstrating each one on a web page.

        <ul>
            <li>Comment to explain why the code works, not how.</li>
            <li>Remember that Symbols are a data type as well.</li>
            <li>Using the keyword "delete" only removes the value, not the item.</li>
            <li>Sets are a data structure that only holds unique values.</li>
            <li>Remember that booleans can be powerful in logic. Look out for 
                what values are inheritly false and true.</li>
            <li>Ternary operators are a shorthand for an if/else statement.
                condition ? true : false. Could be very handy to use in code.
            </li>
            <li>Always break in switches. And don't forget about the default condition.</li>
            <li>Anything over a certain value is given the value/error of "infinity".</li>
            <li>Keep functions "DRY".</li>
            <li>Keep track of scope, OOP prinicples can be very handy in utilizing functions.</li>
            <li>Callbacks are functions that are passed as an argument to a different function. It's like when
                an actress gets a "callback" to be heard from again. Our functions are doing the same
                and get the chance to act again.
